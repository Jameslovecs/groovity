/**
 * Marker for data objects that are shared, i.e. not cloned on retrieval from the factory.  This
 * can be used to improve performance for objects intended to be used in a read-only manner, while it makes data mutations 
 * dangerous in the sense that they are visible to all callers and subject to race conditions, and yet transient since they are not persisted.  
 * 
 * In other words, only use this API for data that will not be mutated by the application, or when the application will perform an explicit clone() 
 * before attempting mutations.  If the application retrieves a SharedModel and mutates without cloning, bad things can and will happen.
